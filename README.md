# Standard-Card-Poker
*Five-card draw* is a variant of poker where each player receives a hand of 5 cards, is then allowed to swap any number of those cards for new ones, and then competes against each other based on the standard 5 card poker hand strength. You need to design and develop a console based application which will deal and evaluate poker hands for a simplified version of the five-card draw variant. Like the five-card draw variant, the application will have to deal a hand of 5 cards, but unlike the five-card draw variant, no swapping will be allowed.
